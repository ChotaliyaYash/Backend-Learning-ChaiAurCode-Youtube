# Backend-Learning-ChaiAurCode-Youtube
A practice repo is created to store the practice file and folders which is created while learning from YouTube.

Thanks to Chai aur Code for creating a wonderful series on backend development.

I try to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript, hope fully it goes smoothly

Thank You!
